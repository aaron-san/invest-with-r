# Finding Stocks at Risk of Financial Distress 

The goal of this analysis is to isolate stocks that are particularly risky to the long-only investor. A probability of distress will be computed based on observable financial data. The model was derived in academia and later utilized in a book titled "Quantitative Value" (2013).

## The Formula

### Logit Probability of Financial Distress (LPFD)
A logistic regression model is used to estimate whether a firm is in financial distress or not. 

$$LPFD = -20.26 \times NIMTAAVG + 1.42 \times TLMTA \\
- 7.13 \times EXRETAVG + 1.41 \times SIGMA \\
- 0.045 \times RSIZE - 2.13 \times CASHMTA + 
\\0.075 \times MB - 0.058 \times PRICE - 9.16 $$


The "LPFD" is then transformed into a probability of financial distress (PFD).

### Probability of Financial Distress (PFD)

$ PFD=\frac{1}{1+e^{-LPFD}} $


### Weighting the value
$ XAVG = .5333 \times t + .2666 \times (t - 1) + .1333 \times (t - 2) + .0666 \times (t - 3) $
